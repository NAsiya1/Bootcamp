          <p>Greetings! My name is Nombulelo Asiya and I am delighted to introduce myself as a part-time 
            tutor and the chairperson of a nonprofit organization called Hearts of Lavender. As an advocate for social justice 
            and comprehensive sexuality education, I established this organization in 2022 to address the 
            pressing issues of teenage pregnancy and other social challenges faced by children and youth. 
            With a diverse vocational background in administration, customer service, magazine writing, and 
            providing psychosocial support to students, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience not only to 
            Hearts of Lavender but any role. My primary goal is to create a society where all individuals are accepted 
            and understood, while eradicating the negative impact of teenage pregnancy. Through Hearts of Lavender's workshops 
            and seminars, we provide comprehensive sexuality education, and I am proud to say that I have 
            obtained a facilitation qualification to effectively deliver these sessions. 
            Furthermore, I have authored two cautionary books for the NPO, which aim to educate and 
            empower children and youth to make responsible choices regarding their sexual health. 
            I am passionate about making a positive impact, and I am determined to continue creating a 
            brighter future for the next generation.
